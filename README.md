# James' The Boredless Tourist
 A Project from Codecademy that I worked on

 This code defines a list of destinations and a list of travelers. It also defines two functions: get_destination_index(destination) returns the index of the specified destination in the destinations list, and get_traveler_location(traveler) uses get_destination_index() to return the index of the destination for a given traveler. The code then defines a list of attractions for each destination and a function add_attraction(destination, attraction) that appends a new attraction to the list of attractions for the specified destination. Finally, the code calls add_attraction() to add a new attraction to the list for "Los Angeles, USA" and prints the attractions list.
